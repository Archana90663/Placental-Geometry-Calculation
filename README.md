# Placental-Geometry-Calculation
This project consists of a .java file that computes the geometrical location of the placenta within the uterus, a .jpg file that contains the picture of the segmented placenta for the user's reference and two .txt files that read in the voxel coordinates of the segmentation for both placenta and uterus.
